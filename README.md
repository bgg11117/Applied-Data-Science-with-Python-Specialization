# Applied Data Science with Python Specialization

Here are the course files from the [Coursera Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python). This is a University of Michigan MOOC.

I'm running the `.ipynb` files either:
* online on Coursera or
* offline using [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/).

My code can be found in the 'Assignment' `.ipynb` files.
